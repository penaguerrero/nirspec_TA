5-stars:   Sets 09 and 11

Priority order for recommended initial test cases:  
Sets 02, 06, 01, 07, 09, 04, 11

Priority order for ALL 20 cases provided here:
Sets 02, 01, 06, 07, 09, 04, 11, 03, 08, 05, 13, 14, 10, 15, 16, 18, 19, 17, 12, 20


Below is a listing giving all 20 cases provided here.  The first column gives the "Set" number which is 
simply an easy index number for quick reference.  The second column gives an "ID" number which is an 
identifying index in our extensive database of test case simulations.  The remaining columns give the 
star numbers from the 200-star list of the stars that comprise each test set.  Some notes about 
each case are provided following the full 20-case listing below.
